        <p>The firm was founded in 1958 as Sedgewick &amp; Associates, later Sedgewick, Sellers, &amp; Associates, Waterstreet Design, P.C., and finally changed to Sedgewick &amp; Ferweda Architects, without change in philosophy or integrity. The firm represents a tradition of over fifty years of providing quality Architectural services to our community and has been responsible for over one billion dollars (current value) of building construction in-place. The work has encompassed a variety of building and structure types, and represents a continuous record of accomplishments. This background is at the disposal of each of our clients. The updated firm will still provide quality Architectural services to our existing clients, without a change in philosophy or integrity.</p>
        <p>Our aim, as originally directed by Tom Sedgewick Sr., and maintained by all of us here, is to be a professional group whose purpose is to translate their clients&#39; desires and wishes into reality. The reality of a humane, pleasing environment, sustainable, economical of construction, budgetable, while accomplishing the clientâ€™s intents and desires.</p>
