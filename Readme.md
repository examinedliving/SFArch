======

This is the uncompiled version of an iPhone / iPad application for Sedgewick & Ferweda Architects.  The library was built with Cordova and several Javascript Libraries listed below.  This is a work in progress that will require refactoring, cleanup, and proper commenting, so I wouldn't advise paying too much attention to the code just yet.  

The following 3rd party resources are included this project:  

  1. [ratchet] -- CSS only (heavily modified)
  2. [fastClick.js]
  3. [iScroll.js]
  4. [flexSlider]
  5. [fitText.js]
  6. [jQuery]
